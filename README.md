# Future-of-Transportation-
Innovia metro is the current name given to an automated rapid transit system manufactured by bombardier transportation. Innovia metro systems run on conventional mental rails and pull power form a third rail, but are powered by a linear induction motor that provides traction by pulling on a "forth rail" placed between the running rails. A new version of the technology being marketed by Bombardier is compatible with standard electric rotary propulsion.

AUTONOMOUS CARS

A Self- driving car, also known as autonomous vehicle, connected and autonomous vehicle, driverless that is capable of sensing its enviroment and moving safely with little to human input.

PROBLEMS IN THE AUTONOMOUS CARS:

*Expensive

*safety and security concerns

*prone to hacking

*fewer job opportunities for others

*non-functional sensors
